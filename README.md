# Reported issues that some users may experience

Sempbul Mu3r Mekur apparently constantly opens the Windows Script Host over and over again on certain systems.. This may be caused by spaces in your userprofile name. My friend Adam also reports to be using his PC as an FTP server. Which may also cause issues
